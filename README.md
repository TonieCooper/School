- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TonieCooper
- I'm currently seeking to leverage my education and work experience into a role as a data scientist within an organization. Excellent at juggling multiple tasks and working under pressure while also maintaining a positive attitude. Passionate about creating new oportunities that will build community and the company.
